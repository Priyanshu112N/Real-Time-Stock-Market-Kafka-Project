# Real-Time-Stock-Market-Kafka-Project

Introduction: In this project, we will build and execute an End-To-End Data Project on Real-Time Stock Market Data using Apache Kafka. Biggest issue faced while building this project when I was connecting to EC2 from command line(CLI): Issues such as - permission‚Äôs error, username error, I had to remove unnecessary permission‚Äôs.
Different technologies used - Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL.
Key Insights:
‚Ä¢	üåê Real-Time Streaming Importance: The significance of real-time data processing in modern applications, such as e-commerce and navigation apps, which rely heavily on timely data updates to enhance user experience.
‚Ä¢	üõ†Ô∏è Kafka Fundamentals: Overview of Kafka, explaining its role as a distributed event store and stream processing platform. This foundational knowledge is vital for anyone looking to work with Kafka in data engineering projects, as it enables them to grasp how data flows through a Kafka ecosystem.
‚Ä¢	‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Integration: The integration of AWS services, such as S3, Glue, and Athena, showcases the power of cloud computing in data processing pipelines. This knowledge is valuable for someone looking to leverage cloud technologies to enhance data storage, processing, and analysis capabilities.
‚Ä¢	üìà Real-Time Data Simulation: The presentation of a simulated stock market data stream illustrates how to create and manage real-time data flows. This practical example provides a relatable context and making it easier to understand the applications of data streaming technologies.
‚Ä¢	üí° Self-Sufficiency in Problem-Solving: Importance of attempting to resolve errors independently before seeking help. This approach fosters resilience and problem-solving skills, which are essential for success.
